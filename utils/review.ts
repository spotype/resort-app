      to the beach and boardwalk so we didn’t have to worry about the kids being too far when
      they traveled up there alone. They enjoyed being by all the ride, games, and ice cream.
      We loved not having to travel to the Jersey shore with a bunch of beach chairs as they
      were provided for us.”`,

      spacious front fire pit it was perfect for our family. We had 8 of our family members in
      the 3 bedroom first floor unit which was beautiful and exceptionally clean upon our
      arrival. We would recommend this house to anyone and we cannot wait to come back
      next summer!”`,

      perfect get away. It is located three houses from the beach and the free 24-hour street
      parking on the block was very convenient. The house was brand new inside and was
      decorated very cute. The outdoor shower was perfect to rinse off after the beach.”`,

      were closed, so we could instead access the house in a short walk. Clean,
